# tortoise_hare

This was a recreation of the classic story of the Tortoise & the Heir. 

 I used random number generation to develop a simulation of the race. Our contenders begin the race at “square 1” of 70 squares. Each square represents a possible position along the race course. The finish line is at square 70. The first contender to reach or pass square 70 wins.

There is a clock that ticks once per second. With each tick of the clock, your program uses function moveTortoise and moveHare to adjust the position of the animals according to a set of rules given. These functions use pointer-based pass-by-reference to modify the position of the tortoise and the hare.
